# Ligth-reader
A very light reader to allow your visitors to read manga or comics online.

# Deps
- Semantic-ui
- jquery
- FileSaver
- JSZipUtils

Very few configs to change in the php scripts

Make sure :
- your series folders are the first in your "bookshelf" (or whatever you named your folder)
- you put an image in the series folder (the name doesn't matter) as it will be used on the "front page".
- the chapter folder name is digits only, as the name will be used in chapter select input.
- the comics/manga pages are only number as the filename (without extension) will be used to order the page and to populate the page select input.

==========================
# TODO

- page lazy loading [X]
- responsiveness
